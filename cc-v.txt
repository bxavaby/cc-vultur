 -> CREATURE COMPENDIUM - Vultures (Part I)

 --> A single-page webapp about vultures: new and old world.


- Approach: mobile-first??

- Style: pixelart, pixelfonts, light tones (not too light, easy on the eyes)

- Layout: centred logo on top -> subtitle below the logo reading
          "Part I - Vultures" -> pixelart images of the vultures
          in a grid layout, no borders, no shadowing, just the .png's
          of each vulture (in pixelart), clickable -> footer, centred,
          with a link to my github page and email

- Need to:

  1. Pick a palette for the site, from lospec, and define it in a themes.css,
     so I can easily test different palettes;
  2. Generate the 23 pixelart png's of the vultures, with specific poses and
     characteristics, but all in the same chibi/cute style;
  3. Pick a nice, clean and suitable wallpaper, maybe a simple grid or pattern
     using the colours of the chosen palette;
  4. Prepare the structure of the site, setup npm with vite for development;
  5. Take crucial info from "The World of Vultures" for each vulture card, in
     order to showcase important info about each vulture species;
  6. Decide on the frameworks to use: tailwind or vanilla css; animation
     libraries or vanilla js; etc;
  7. Pick a nice, sweet track to play softly in the background of the site.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Vulture pixelart creation:

  1. Use SORA or pixie.haus for the creation, with specifically crafted prompts;
  2. A prompt per vulture species, key differences, but overall similar;
  3. All the same size and with a transparent background;
  4. May take the png's into asprite and add some touches, fixes, refinements;
  5. More on each vulture section below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Vulture layout grid:

  1. Each vulture is clickable, kind of like a button/card;
  2. On hover, highlight the vulture by making the png slightly bigger and
     the rest of the vultures opaque or darkened (overlay);
  3. On click, not sure about this yet, but perhaps hide the other vultures
     and open a big, centred vulture-card of the vulture in question;
  4. Tap outside or on a right-corner cross to leave the card and go back to
     the grid view;

Idea:
Perhaps have two grids, one for New World Vultures and another for Old
World Vutures with a slight gap in the middle - each grid will have a soft
opacity and the category "Old/New World Vultures" on top, centred, covering
the entire layout of the corresponding category -, remove opacity and show
the vultures on hover, etc...

- Vultures: New World (7) and OLd World (16)

1. New World

-> Black Vulture Coragyps atratus

Spanish: Zopilote Negro, Aura Negro
German: Rabengeier
French: Urubu Noir
aka: American Black Vulture, Gallinazo, Carrion Crow (obsolete)
Taxonomy: Family Cathartidae
Size: Length 26 in (56–74 cm); wingspan 58 in (150 cm); 3.0–5.0 lb
(1400–2200 g)
Estimated world population: >>10,000,000; increasing
Movements: Largely sedentary except near latitudinal limits of its
range; sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Individual nesting; communal roosting; individual
and group food finding

Special trait(s): Lacking a sniffing sense, but street-smart. Black Vultures
                have a poor sense of smell and instead watch their Turkey
                Vulture cousins to locate food. In the wild, they often soar
                in search of carcasses and cleverly follow the “noses” of
                other vultures, an unusual strategy that lets them find meals
                their own nostrils would miss. Unlike most vultures, Black
                Vultures can be surprisingly bold – occasionally pecking at
                live newborn animals or feasting on unexpected food like
                pumpkins and even picking ticks off capybaras. This
                opportunistic streak sets them apart from more finicky
                scavengers.

Designed prompt: In a cute pixel-art design, a chibi Black Vulture could be
                 shown happily munching on a pumpkin or holding a tick in
                 its beak, emphasizing its “anything goes” appetite in an
                 adorable way.


-> Turkey Vulture Cathartes aura

Spanish: Aura Cabeza Roja
German: Truthhahngeier
French: Urubu à Tête Rouge
aka: Turkey Buzzard
Taxonomy: Family Cathartidae
Size: Length 25–32 in (64–81cm); wingspan 66–80 in (170–200 cm);
3–5 lb (1400–2400 g)
Estimated world population: 13,000,000; increasing
Movements: Partial migrant; some migratory populations long-­
distance, trans-equatorial and transcontinental
Social ecology: Individual territorial nesting; communal roosting;
individual and group food finding

Special trait(s): Super-sniffer of the skies. Turkey Vultures are
                  famous for their keen sense of smell, a rare talent
                  in the bird world. They can detect the scent of decay
                  from high above the forest canopy, allowing them to
                  find hidden carcasses that other vultures (like the
                  Black Vulture) would never notice. This super-olfactory
                  ability gives them an edge in ecosystems – they often
                  locate food first by smell, unlike most vultures that
                  rely solely on eyesight.

Designed prompt: To illustrate this in chibi pixel form, one could show
                 a cute Turkey Vulture with exaggerated, sniffing nostrils.


-> Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture Cathartes burrovianus

Spanish: Aura Cabeza Amarilla
German: Kleiner Gelbkopfgeier
French: Urubu à Tête Jaune
aka: Savanna Vulture
Taxonomy: Family Cathartidae
Size: Length 23–26 in (58–66 cm); wingspan 63 in (160 cm); 2 lb
(950 g)
Estimated world population: c. 100,000; possibly decreasing but
likely stable, no indication of population increases anywhere in
its range
Movements: Largely sedentary; sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Individual nesting; communal roosting, sometimes
with other species; largely individual food finding

Special trait(s): Low-flying swamp glider. This smaller vulture is
                  uniquely adapted to skim just above the ground in
                  wetlands and savannas, riding small air currents
                  only a meter or two high. By flying so low, it can
                  surprise live prey like fish, frogs, or even
                  snakes – an unusual hunting habit for a vulture.
                  This ecological quirk lets it catch meals that other
                  vultures, soaring high, would miss. It also sports a
                  bright candy-colored head – living individuals have
                  bare skin in sunny yellows and oranges with random
                  blue patches. No two faces are quite alike, which might
                  help these birds recognize each other. Compared to its
                  well-known relative the Turkey Vulture, the Lesser
                  Yellow-Headed Vulture is lighter and more agile, with a
                  wider bill to gobble goodies quickly.

Designed prompt: In pixel art, we could show a cute Lesser Yellow-Head gliding
                 low over a marsh, maybe with a frog or fish in sight, to convey
                 its skimming flight and hunting behavior.


-> Greater Yellow-headed Vulture Cathartes melambrotus

Spanish: Aura alas Anchas, Aura Silvatica
German: Großer Gelbkopfgeier
French: Grand Urubu
aka: Forest Vulture
Taxonomy: Family Cathartidae
Size: Length 25–30 in (64–75 cm); wingspan 66 in (170 cm); 3.6 lb
(1.65 kg)
Estimated world population: 10,000–100,000; possibly decreasing
but most likely stable, no indication of population increases any-
where in its range
Movements: Largely sedentary; some wandering
Social ecology: Individual nesting; communal roosting, sometimes
with C. aura; largely individual food finding

Special trait(s): Shy forest shadow. This vulture sticks to steamy Amazonian
                  forests, using its strong sense of smell and low soaring style
                  to find carcasses under the canopy. It’s heftier than its
                  lesser yellow-headed cousin, with broader wings for gliding
                  over treetops. What really sets it apart is how it often partners
                  with the King Vulture: the Greater Yellow-Headed Vulture will trail
                  behind a King Vulture to a carcass, then let the “king” rip it open
                  with his powerful bill. Once the tough hide is torn, the Greater
                  Yellow-Head swoops in for its share. Unlike the smaller Turkey Vulture,
                  it’s not easily bossed around by them – in fact, it can hold its own in
                  a squabble with a Turkey Vulture due to its size.

Designed prompt: For a chibi pixel character, picture a bashful-looking vulture peeking
                 out from dense foliage, maybe with big “puppy eyes” and a cute sweat drop
                 (anime-style) to show its patience in waiting.


-> King Vulture Sarcoramphus papa

Spanish: Zopilote Rey
German: Königsgeier
French: Sarcoramphie roi
Taxonomy: Family Cathartidae
Size: Length 28–32 in (71–81 cm); wingspan 70–79 in (180–200 cm);
6.5–8.4 lb (3.0–3.8 kg)
Estimated world population: <10,000; possibly decreasing
Movements: Sedentary; sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Individual nesting: communal roosting; individual
and group food finding

Special trait(s): The carnival-colored carcass king. With a brilliantly multicolored head and
                  neck that looks hand-painted in oranges, purples, and yellows, the King Vulture
                  is arguably the most eye-catching vulture in the world. Its vivid, wrinkled face
                  (complete with a comical fleshy crest on the bill) doesn’t just look cool – it
                  likely helps King Vultures identify each other and perhaps signal their mood
                  (zookeepers can tell individuals apart by the size of their face wattles!). Beyond
                  looks, this species has a massive beak that functions like a can-opener on large
                  carcasses. While King Vultures aren’t always the first at a dead animal, when they
                  arrive they can tear open thick skin that smaller vultures (like Turkey or Black
                  Vultures) struggle with. This benefits the whole clean-up crew, as it lets others
                  access the juicy insides. No other New World vulture has such a combination of
                  heavy bill and wild coloration.

Designed prompt: A cute pixel King Vulture could be depicted wearing a little crown or cape.


-> California Condor Gymnogyps californianus

Spanish: Cóndor Californiano
German: Kalifornischer Kondor
French: Condor de Californie
aka: California Vulture (obsolete)
Taxonomy: Family Cathartidae
Size: Length 46–53 in (117–134 cm); wingspan c. 106 in (270 cm);
18–31 lb (8–14 kg)
Estimated world population: <1000; increasing
Movements: Sedentary; sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Individual nesting; communal roosting; individual
and group food finding

Special trait(s): Giant of the coast. The California Condor is one of the largest flying birds in
                  the world, with a wingspan up to 3 meters (10 feet) across – wider than a person
                  is tall. Those huge wings let it glide for hundreds of kilometers, effortlessly
                  riding thermal updrafts as it scans for food. In ecology, this condor fills the
                  role of a megascavenger: it can dine on gigantic carcasses that smaller vultures
                  can’t tackle, historically including beached whales and even salmon runs. With
                  its powerful build and endurance, it will travel from mountaintop to seashore in
                  search of the next feast, soaring all day without flapping. Unlike more gregarious
                  vultures, California Condors are relatively few and far between – they live long
                  (up to 60 years!) and raise young slowly, which made their population vulnerable
                  when threats like lead poisoning emerged.

Designed prompt: In pixel art, a California Condor character could be shown with outstretched wings
                 and a fish in its beak to hint at its historic diet of marine carcasses.


-> Andean Condor Vultur gryphus

Spanish: Cóndor Andino
German: Andenkondor
French: Condor de Andes
Taxonomy: Family Cathartidae
Size: Length 40–51 in (100–130 cm); wingspan >126 in (>320 cm);
18–33 lb (8–15 kg)
Estimated world population: <15,000; decreasing
Movements: Sedentary; occasionally nomadic and migratory
Social ecology: Individual nesting; communal roosting; individual
and group food finding

Special trait(s): Lord of the Andes winds. The Andean Condor rides the mountain gusts of South America
                  with incredible skill – a recent study showed it can fly for hours without flapping,
                  simply gliding on air currents as if it were a living airplane. This vulture is huge
                  and heavy (males can top 15 kg), yet it conserves energy so well that it scarcely needs
                  to flap its 10-foot wings except during takeoff. In the wild, an Andean Condor can
                  cover vast distances across the Andes in search of llamas, deer, or cattle carcasses.
                  Uniquely, this species shows reverse sexual size dimorphism – the male condors are bigger
                  than the females (opposite of most birds of prey) and sport a noticeable fleshy comb on
                  their heads. This means in condor society, Dad is not only a bit flashier but can also
                  push his weight around at carcasses, often eating first. Males have a distinct crest and
                  wattle, whereas females don’t, making pairs look quite “mismatched” – a peculiar trait
                  among vultures.

Designed prompt: To represent the Andean Condor in pixel form, we could illustrate a majestic chibi
                 condor maybe with little wind swirls to show it surfing the breeze.

2. Old World

-> Palm-nut Vulture Gypohierax angolensis

Spanish: Buitre Palmero
German: Palmgeier
French: Palmiste Africain
aka: Vulturine Fish-eagle
Taxonomy: Subfamily Gypaetinae
Size: Length 22–26 in (57–65 cm); wingspan 69–83 in (175–210 cm);
2.6–4 lb (1200–1800 g)
Estimated world population: 240,000; stable
Movements: Sedentary
Social ecology: Often gregarious; individual nesting; communal
roosting; both individual and group food finding

Special trait(s): The vegetarian vulture. Unlike its meat-loving cousins, the Palm-Nut Vulture thrives
                  on a diet of fruits and veggies – specifically the oily fruit of palm trees for much
                  of the year. In fact, this African vulture is so hooked on palm nuts that it behaves
                  more like a strange fruit-eating hawk than a typical scavenger. It will sit in palm
                  trees and feast on the fleshy palm fruits, obtaining plenty of energy without ever
                  touching a carcass. Of course, it still snacks on the occasional fish or crab and will
                  eat carrion opportunistically, but it’s the only vulture that could literally be friends
                  with a vegetarian. This dietary quirk sets it apart from all 22 other vulture species!
                  Additionally, Palm-Nut Vultures have an eagle-like appearance – adults are crisp white
                  with black wing patches, and they perch upright rather than hunching, looking quite dapper.
                  Ecologically, their fruit habit means they can live in coastal mangroves and wetlands where
                  carcasses are scarce but palm trees are abundant, carving out a niche all their own.

Designed prompt: A pixel-art Palm-Nut Vulture could play on this unique trait by showing a cute vulture
                 holding a bright orange palm fruit.


-> Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus

Spanish: Quebrantahuesos
German: Bartgeier
French: Gypaète barbu
aka: Lammergeier
Taxonomy: Subfamily Gypaetinae
Size: Length 37–49 in (94–125 cm); wingspan 91–112 in (230–
285 cm); 10–16 lb (4800–7200 g)
Estimated world population: <30,000; recent rapid decline
Movements: Sedentary; immatures sometimes wide-ranging and
nomadic
Social ecology: Solitary; territorial nesting; individual and group
food finding

Special trait(s): Bone-cracker extraordinaire. The Bearded Vulture (also called Lammergeier) has a diet
                  and behavior straight out of a fantasy story: it eats bones – and dyes its feathers
                  orange for style! Up to 90% of this vulture’s diet is bone material. It will carry large
                  bones high into the air and drop them onto rocks to shatter them into bite-sized bits.
                  This bone-dropping habit is unique among living vultures (and really all vertebrates)
                  – it’s like having a built-in nutcracker for skeletons. By accessing the nutritious marrow
                  inside bones, the Bearded Vulture fills an important niche, cleaning up the last scraps
                  that other scavengers leave behind. To digest this calcium-rich diet, it has super acidic
                  stomach juices and an elastic throat to swallow sizable chunks. As if that weren’t distinctive
                  enough, adult Bearded Vultures deliberately stain their whitish feathers a rusty orange by
                  bathing in iron-rich mud, giving them a fiery “beard” and body hue. This cosmetic behavior
                  doesn’t occur in other vultures – it’s believed they do it to appear more formidable or attractive.
                  In comparison to other vultures, they also have a fully feathered face with a little black “goatee”
                  tuft, which gives them a bearded appearance.

Designed prompt: For a chibi pixel design, imagine a Bearded Vulture proudly clutching a big bone
                 or posing besides a skull.


-> Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus

Spanish: Alimoche Común
German: Schmutzgeier
French: Vautour percnoptère
aka: Scavenger Vulture, Pharaoh’s Chicken
Taxonomy: Subfamily Gypaetinae
Size: Length 21–26 in (54–66 cm); wingspan 57–69 in (145–175 cm);
3.5–5.3 lb (1585–2400 g)
Estimated world population: <10,000; recent declines
Movements: Partial migrant; immatures nomadic
Social ecology: Largely gregarious; sometimes nests in loose colo-
nies; communal roosting; group food finding

Special trait(s): Tool-user and dung gourmet. The small Egyptian Vulture is one clever scavenger – it famously
                  uses tools, a rarity in birds. When it encounters a large egg (like an ostrich egg), too tough
                  to break by beak, it will pick up a stone in its bill and hurl it at the egg to crack it open.
                  This smart “egg-smashing” trick sets it apart from virtually all other raptors and earned it the
                  nickname “Pharaoh’s Chicken” in some cultures. In the vulture world, only the Egyptian (and a few
                  distant cousins like Hooded Vultures on smaller eggs) are known to wield rocks as tools, showing
                  a surprising bit of avian ingenuity. Another quirky trait: Egyptian Vultures aren’t above eating
                  dung – yes, they will happily sift through animal poop, especially of ungulates (like cows or
                  elephants), to pick out nutritious bits and carotenoid pigments. This habit gives them nutrients
                  and also turns their faces a brighter yellow-orange (a cosmetic boost from beta-carotenes in dung!).
                  Other vultures usually avoid digestive leftovers, but the Egyptian makes a living in part by being
                  Mother Nature’s sanitizer in this way.

Designed prompt: To illustrate these traits in a playful pixel character, we could have an Egyptian Vulture holding
                 a little stone next to a giant egg, cartoon cracks appearing in the egg to show what it’s up to.
                 The character might wear a determined expression as it “aims” its rock. Alternatively, it could be
                 drawn with a comical oversized spoon and a poop emoji in a bowl (a lighthearted nod to its dung dining)
                 – though done in a cute, non-gross style (perhaps the vulture giving a cheeky grin).


-> Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus

Spanish: Alimoche Sombrío
German: Kappengeier
French: Vautour charognod
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 21–26 in (54–66 cm); wingspan 59–71 in (150–180 cm);
3.0–5.7 lb (1400–2600 g).
Estimated world population: <200,000; decreasing
Movements: Sedentary; adults largely sedentary; immatures episod-
ically nomadic
Social ecology: Solitary to gregarious; solitary and loose colonial
nesting; solitary and communal roosting; individual and group
food finding.

Special trait(s): Little garbage collector. The Hooded Vulture is a small, thin-beaked African vulture with a big
                  ecological role: it acts like a vacuum cleaner for leftovers. While larger vultures tear into
                  carcasses, the Hooded Vulture patiently waits on the sidelines and then moves in to pick up tiny
                  scraps, gristle, and even maggots that others leave behind. Its slender bill is perfect for nabbing
                  morsels from nooks and crannies, much like a pair of tweezers. This makes it different from big
                  fellows like White-backed or Lappet-faced Vultures, which go for large chunks – the Hooded specializes
                  in the bite-sized bits. It often hangs around human settlements too, becoming an urban scavenger that
                  cleans up abattoir waste, street garbage, and even excrement (earning it nicknames like “garbage vulture”).
                  In parts of West Africa, Hooded Vultures are the most common vulture in towns, trotting around markets
                  and slaughterhouses looking for discarded meat or fish scraps. They’re so opportunistic that they’ve been
                  seen using stones to crack open smaller bird eggs, a mini version of the Egyptian Vulture’s tool use.
                  They’re also bold around predators – not as easily spooked by lions or hyenas – because they know those
                  giants provide dinner leftovers.

Designed prompt: For a pixel-art portrayal, a Hooded Vulture chibi could be depicted rummaging through a tiny garbage can
                 or with a banana peel on its head, or holding a broom and dustpan as if “sweeping” up scraps.


-> Indian Vulture Gyps indicus

Spanish: Buitre indio
German: Indiengeier
French: Vautour indien
aka: Long-billed Vulture
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 32–41 in (81–103 cm); wingspan 77–102 in (196–
258 cm); 12–14 lb (5500–6300 g)
Estimated world population: <30,000; recent rapid decline
Movements: Sedentary; immatures somewhat nomadic
Social ecology: Gregarious; communal nesting and roosting; group
food finding

Special trait(s): Cliff dweller of the east. The Indian Vulture – also known as the Long-billed Vulture – has a
                  distinctive lifestyle among its Gyps vulture cousins in Asia: it prefers to nest on cliffs and
                  tall buildings rather than in trees. This species historically formed colonies on remote crags
                  or the ledges of ruins, overlooking villages where they would soar out to clean up livestock
                  carcasses. In ecology, their cliffside habit meant they often lived near human habitations (in
                  semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan) and played a major role as sanitation workers. Compared
                  to tree-nesting White-rumped Vultures or Slender-billed Vultures, the Indian Vulture’s choice of
                  high perches gave it a safe zone away from ground predators and a broad vantage point to spot food.
                  It also has a stouter bill and neck than the Slender-billed Vulture, indicating it was adapted to
                  rip into carcasses a bit earlier in the “feast” (soft parts and moderate hide) – the slender-billed
                  would then reach the narrower crevices. Sadly, this vulture became famous for a negative reason: it
                  was one of the three species nearly wiped out by veterinary drug poisoning in the 1990s, which is not
                  a “trait” per se, but it does highlight how unique their role was – when they declined, towns were
                  suddenly littered with rotting carcasses.

Designed prompt: In a creative pixel art piece, we could show an Indian Vulture looking proud and vigilant, as if surveying
                 its kingdom from on high – a nod to its status as a once super-common vulture that literally lived above
                 everyone, doing essential cleanup.


-> Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris

Spanish: Buitre picofino
German: Dünnschnabelgeier
French: Vautour á long bec
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 30–40 in (77–103 cm); wingspan 77–102 in (196–258) cm;
mass, no data
Estimated world population: <2,500; declining
Movements: Largely sedentary; immatures sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Solitary to highly gregarious; solitary and loose colo-
nial nesting; communal roosting; individual and group food
finding

Special trait(s): Needle-nosed scavenger. True to its name, this vulture has an exceptionally slender, long beak and
                  neck, which give it a distinct silhouette. That adaptation isn’t just for show – it allows the
                  Slender-Billed Vulture to reach deep inside carcasses and pick at soft organs that thicker-billed
                  vultures have trouble accessing. Essentially, it’s the specialist for getting the last shreds of meat
                  from between ribs and vertebrae, acting like nature’s toothpick. This sets it apart from its close cousin
                  the Indian Vulture, which has a bulkier bill better suited for general tearing. The Slender-Billed Vulture
                  also had a slightly different lifestyle: it is a tree-nester in lowland forests and wetland areas, often
                  building solitary nests high in tall trees, whereas the Indian Vulture prefers cliffs. This difference means
                  the Slender-Billed was more of a rural wetland resident, sometimes in small loose colonies along rivers, in
                  contrast to the more urban or cliffside Indian Vulture. Behaviorally, both species were friends with people
                  (often found near villages eating cattle carcasses), but the Slender-Billed’s extreme bill suggests it might
                  have been the one to clean up the deep stuff after Indian and White-rumped Vultures took the easy pickings.

Designed prompt: In pixel art form, a Slender-Billed Vulture character could exaggerate that skinny beak to comic effect –
                 perhaps a tiny-headed, long-beaked chibi vulture or have it use its beak as a straw or chopstick in a bowl
                 of “soup” (representing gooey carrion soup!) to highlight how it can slurp up things out of reach for others.


-> White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis

Spanish: Buitre Dorsiblanco Bengali
German: Bengalengeier
French: Vautour chaugoun
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 30–34 in (75–85 cm); wingspan 76–84 in (192–213 cm);
8–13 lb (3500–5700 g)
Estimated world population: <10,000; recent declines
Movements: Largely sedentary; immatures sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Largely gregarious; loose communal nesting and
communal roosting; group food finding

Special trait(s): Once in a million (or rather, millions). The White-Rumped Vulture holds the bittersweet title of possibly
                  once being the most abundant large bird of prey in the world. Until the 1980s, it was extremely common across
                  South Asia – soaring in huge flocks and nesting in big colonies, sometimes with dozens of nests in a single
                  tree. This hyper-social behavior is a distinctive trait: White-Rumped Vultures would gather by the hundreds
                  at a carcass, efficiently stripping a cow to bare bones within minutes. Their communal approach (a true “vulture
                  party”) meant that they outnumbered and out-competed many other scavengers in their range. Ecologically, they
                  were the cleanup crew for both cities and countryside, thriving alongside human society. Their name comes from
                  a conspicuous white patch of feathers above the tail, which flashes when they are in flight or squabbling – a
                  visual signal to others in the flock. Compared to African vultures, these guys were smaller but far more numerous,
                  forming the backbone of South Asia’s scavenging system. Tragically, a rapid poisoning event crashed their population
                  by >95%, but conservation efforts are ongoing to bring this remarkable species back.

Designed prompt: In designing a playful pixel tribute, one could draw a smiling chibi White-Rumped Vulture and emphasize the white rump.


-> Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus

Spanish: Buitre Leonardo
German: Gänsegeier
French: Vautour fauve
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 37–43 in (93–110 cm); wingspan 53–106 (135–270 cm);
14–25 lb (6200–11,300 g)
Estimated world population: 650,000–690,000; increasing overall
Movements: Sedentary; adults largely sedentary; immatures nomadic-
migratory
Social ecology: Solitary to gregarious; communal nesting and roost-
ing; individual and group food finding

Special trait(s): High flyer and herd follower. The Griffon Vulture is a big, buff-colored vulture of Europe and Asia, known
                  for its impressive migratory journeys. What stands out about Griffon Vultures is how they follow herds and
                  human pastoralists in a very strategic way. In Europe, flocks of Griffons will track traditional livestock
                  movements – for example, shepherds moving flocks to mountain pastures – and the vultures soar overhead, ready
                  to clean up any animals that die along the route. This ancient practice of transhumance created a partnership:
                  the vultures get a regular food supply, and the herders get free disposal of carcasses. No wonder Griffons
                  developed strong soaring and navigation skills, crossing mountain ranges like the Pyrenees or Himalayas
                  seasonally. They also congregate at famous migration bottlenecks (like the Rock of Gibraltar) in large numbers
                  each year, showing a social, migratory side not all vultures have. With a wingspan around 2.5 meters, they can
                  ride thermals to great heights (though not quite Rüppell’s height record) and travel far. Once nearly in trouble,
                  Griffon Vultures have rebounded in some areas thanks to protections, making them a rare vulture conservation
                  success story.

Designed prompt: For a pixel-art depiction, imagine a Griffon Vulture with a little knapsack or map, looking like a traveler.
                 We could show it with a cow or sheep emoji in its thought bubble, hinting at its habit of tailing herds.


-> Rüppell’s Vulture Gyps rueppellii

Spanish: Buitre Moteado
German: Sperbergeier
French: Vautour de Rüppell
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 33–38 in (85–97 cm); wingspan 89–100 (226–255 cm);
15–20 lb (6800–9000 g)
Estimated world population: <22,000; declining in portions of its
range
Movements: A largely sedentary but wide-ranging sometimes par-
tial migrant
Social ecology: Gregarious; communal nesting and roosting; group
food finding

Special trait(s): The Everest flier. Rüppell’s Vulture holds the astonishing record for the highest confirmed flight of any
                  bird, having been spotted (unfortunately, colliding with an airplane) at 37,000 feet above sea level. That’s
                  higher than Mount Everest’s peak! This African vulture has special hemoglobin in its blood that allows it to
                  absorb oxygen even in the thin air at extreme altitudes, a critical adaptation for soaring above the Serengeti
                  in search of the next meal. By flying so high, Rüppell’s Vultures can spot carcasses from miles away and then
                  swoop down before other scavengers even know what’s happening. They often feed alongside White-backed Vultures,
                  but Rüppell’s are a bit larger and can arrive slightly later to a carcass (since they scan from higher up).
                  However, they also rely on their excellent eyesight and social foraging – they’ll join big “kettles” of vultures
                  spiraling up on thermals. This species is clad in striking checkered plumage and a neat white ruff, making it
                  look like it’s wearing a speckled shawl.

Designed prompt: To show off Rüppell’s sky-high habit in pixel art, we could create a chibi Rüppell’s Vulture wearing vintage
                 aviator goggles and a scarf fluttering in the wind – like a tiny pilot.


-> Himalayan Vulture Gyps himalayensis

Spanish: Buitre del Himalaya
German: Schneegeier
French: Vautour de l’Himalaya
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 33–38 in (85–97 cm); wingspan 89–100in (226–255 cm);
17.6–26.4 lb (8000–12000 g)
Estimated world population: <35,000; possibly decreasing
Movements: Largely sedentary; sometime altitudinal migrant
Social ecology: Small colony nesting, communal and individual
roosting, individual and group food finding

Special trait(s): Mountain monk. The Himalayan Vulture is a giant of the peaks, often seen circling among the world’s tallest
                  mountains. It’s one of the largest Old World vultures, with a massive wingspan and thick fluffy down to keep
                  it warm in the thin, chilly air of the Himalayas. This species’ lifestyle is unique: it feeds on dead livestock
                  and wildlife in remote high-altitude meadows and along cliffs, and it has even become part of the region’s cultural
                  fabric through sky burials. In parts of Tibet and Nepal, when people perform sky burials (exposing human bodies
                  for scavengers), Himalayan Vultures are among the birds that come to consume the remains. In doing so, they perform
                  a sacred service, “releasing” the soul by cleaning up the body – a role no other vulture plays so directly in human
                  ritual. Ecologically, they dominate smaller vultures in their range (like beating out any White-rumped Vulture that
                  wanders up high), though they defer to the even larger Cinereous Vulture when their ranges overlap. They often move
                  seasonally up and down mountains (soaring over 7,000 m passes) following food availability.

Designed prompt: For a Himalayan Vulture pixel character, one could lean into a gentle smile, conveying a wise or zen personality.
                 To hint at its diet, a small yak skull or bone could lie at its side.


-> White-backed Vulture Gyps africanus

Spanish: Buitre Dorsiblanco Africano
German: Weißrückengeier
French: Vautour African
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 31–35 in (78–90 cm); wingspan 78–90 in (197–229 cm);
9.2–15.8 lb (4200–7200 g)
Estimated world population: 270,000; severe declines
Movements: Largely sedentary; immatures sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Solitary to highly gregarious; communal roosting;
solitary and loose colonial nesting; individual and group food
finding

Special trait(s): Savanna team player. The African White-Backed Vulture is the smallest of Africa’s vultures, but it more than
                  makes up for size with sheer numbers and enthusiasm. These vultures are the classic “swarm” that descends on
                  a carcass in the savanna – arriving sometimes within minutes of a zebra or wildebeest dying. They use each
                  other as lookouts: once one finds a meal, many others follow quickly (a big social network in the sky). With
                  their relatively light build and agile flight, White-Backeds specialize in devouring the soft guts and organs
                  of carcasses. They dive right in to tug out intestines and other squishy bits, which are easier for them to
                  swallow compared to tougher hide or bones. In fact, these vultures often leave the skin and sinew for larger
                  species like the Lappet-faced Vulture to clean up later. In ecological terms, they are the quick cleanup crew
                  that clears the bulk of the meat rapidly, helping to prevent disease spread. They nest in trees, often building
                  loose colonies where multiple nests might dot the same acacia grove. And when not breeding, they roost in large
                  groups too – it’s all about cooperation and numbers with this species.

Designed prompt: To capture the White-Backed Vulture’s spirit in pixel art, one idea is to illustrate one chibi vulture wearing a
                 backpack or team jersey to symbolize being a team player (a pun on “back-pack” for white-“backed”!).


-> Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres

Spanish: Buitre de El Cabo
German: Kapgeier British
French: Vautour chassefiente
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 37–41 in (95–105 cm); wingspan 90–98 in (228–250 cm);
16–24 lb (7100–10,900 g)
Estimated world population: <10,000; declining
Movements: Adults largely sedentary; juveniles sometimes nomadic
Social ecology: Colonial nesting; communal nesting and roosting;
group food finding

Special trait(s): Cliff colonist. The Cape Vulture, native to southern Africa, is notable for its immense breeding colonies on
                  cliffs – sometimes over 600 pairs nesting side by side on narrow ledges. Imagine a whole cliff face speckled
                  with big nesting birds; it’s quite the sight and truly unique to this species (most vultures don’t nest in
                  such huge, dense groups). This colonial life means Cape Vultures are very social and communicate constantly –
                  squabbling over space, greeting their mates, and synchronizing their daily foraging forays. They are also among
                  the heaviest of the Gyps vultures, with powerful broad wings to carry them over the Drakensberg mountains and
                  beyond. Cape Vultures often forage in groups and tend to stay within about 40–60 km of their colony when raising
                  chicks, which is relatively local compared to wandering species – they have a hometown and they stick to it,
                  relying on communal knowledge of the landscape. Interestingly, their scientific name coprotheres means “dung
                  hunter,” owing to an old misconception – while they’ve been seen at animal dung (possibly eating bone fragments
                  or insects in it), they don’t actually eat poop as a primary food like an Egyptian Vulture does. They prefer good
                  old meat, especially from domestic livestock carcasses. Because of their size, they can bully smaller vultures
                  aside, though they yield to the top-dog Lappet-faced Vulture in disputes.

Designed prompt: For a pixel art concept, a Cape Vulture character could be shown wearing a little safety helmet or miner’s hat
                 (a playful nod to living on a rocky ledge) to accentuate the cliff theme.


-> Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus

Spanish: Buitre Cabecirrojo
German: Kahlkopfgeier
French: Vautour royal
aka: King Vulture, Pondicherry Vulture
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 30–34 in (76–86 cm); wingspan 79–89 in (200–225 cm);
8.0–12.0 lb (3700–5400 g)
Estimated world population: <15,000; declining in parts of range
Movements: Largely sedentary, but sometimes wide-ranging
Social ecology: Largely solitary; territorial nesting and roosting;
group food finding

Special trait(s): The solitary sentry. The Red-Headed Vulture – sometimes called the Asian King Vulture – breaks the vulture
                  mold by leading a mostly solitary, territorial life. Instead of flocking, this species lives in isolated
                  pairs that guard a large territory, much like hawks or eagles do. In the days when they were more common
                  across India and Southeast Asia, you’d usually see just one or two Red-Headed Vultures at a carcass, not a
                  crowd. They often show up early in the morning, scouting for small carcasses or leftovers before the gang of
                  bigger Gyps vultures arrive. This early-bird habit is possible because Red-Headeds (and their African counterpart,
                  the White-headed Vulture) have relatively low wing loading and can take off in cooler air – so they wake up and
                  get to work sooner. Physically, they are immediately recognizable by their bright, bald red head and floppy skin
                  folds on the sides of their neck (the “lappets”). Their body is mostly black with gleaming white thighs, making
                  them look rather elegant in a stark way. The red bare head can flush an even deeper red when they’re excited or
                  agitated, which is a signal others can probably see – no other Asian vulture has such a striking color change
                  feature. Functionally, their strong beak lets them open moderately tough hides, so they often could start on a
                  carcass that smaller scavengers (like crows or jackals) couldn’t rip into, but they’d then be pushed aside by the
                  larger vultures when those arrived.

Designed prompt: In pixel art, we can play up the “lonely guardian” aspect: perhaps depict a chibi Red-Headed Vulture wearing a
                 tiny pair of binoculars to indicate it’s always watching its territory for food intruders.


-> White-headed Vulture Aegypius occipitalis

Spanish: Buitre Cabeciblanco
German: Wollkopfgeier
French: Vautour à tête blanche
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 28–32 in (72–82 cm); wingspan 80–89 in (205–225 cm);
7.0–12.0 lb (3300–5300 g)
Estimated world population: <6,000; decreasing
Movements: Sedentary; immatures more nomadic
Social ecology: Solitary, territorial nesting; individual and group
food finding

Special trait(s): Eagle in vulture’s clothing. The White-Headed Vulture of Africa is often described as having more “raptor-like”
                  behaviors than other vultures. It is frequently seen hunting small animals – picking off lizards, small mammals,
                  or bird eggs when it can – in addition to scavenging. In fact, its field of vision is more like a hawk’s, with
                  binocular focus straight ahead, which helps in hunting live prey. This predatory tendency is quite distinct; most
                  vultures strictly stick to carrion. Like the Red-Headed Vulture, the White-Headed is also a territorial solitary
                  nester, with pairs defending huge territories and nesting in tall trees apart from other vultures. They are often
                  the first to locate carcasses in the morning because they can fly in weaker thermal currents (thanks to relatively
                  big wing surface for their weight). Once they find something, they might start feeding, but interestingly, they
                  don’t like big vulture crowds – if a swarm of African White-Backed Vultures shows up, the White-Headed will often
                  pull back (they’re somewhat timid in the scrum). They’ll return later when the frenzy dies down to pick at the
                  remains, especially enjoying the tougher bits like tendons and skin that are left. Visually, this vulture has a
                  striking white fluffy head (hence the name) with a rosy-pink face and blue eyeshadow-like patches – almost like
                  it’s wearing makeup. Its wings and body are a mix of black, chestnut, and white, giving it a “dressed-up” look
                  more colorful than many vultures.

Designed prompt: For a pixel portrayal, imagine a White-Headed Vulture as a cute sentry or scout, maybe saluting or hand over brow
                 as if scanning the horizon. Because of its semi-predatory nature, we could give it a tiny spear or net – something
                 playful to imply it might catch its own dinner.


-> Cinereous Vulture Aegypius monachus

Spanish: Buitre Negro
German: Mönchsgeier
French: Vautour moine
aka: Black Vulture, Monk Vulture
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 39–47 in (100–120 cm); wingspan 98–116 in (250–
295 cm); 15–25 lb (7000–11,500 g)
Estimated world population: <32,000; decreasing
Movements: Partial migrant
Social ecology: Solitary nesting; communal roosting; individual
and group food finding

Special trait(s): The black giant. Also known as the Eurasian Black Vulture, this is one of the largest vultures on the planet,
                  and it acts like it. With a 3-meter wingspan and a formidable build, the Cinereous Vulture is often an apex
                  scavenger in its range – others typically give way when this big dark shadow arrives. Uniquely, it’s been known
                  to kill small animals outright if the opportunity arises. Rabbits, young lambs, even unwary fox pups – this
                  vulture’s powerful bill and strength mean it blurs the line between pure scavenger and occasional predator.
                  That’s a rare trait; most vultures don’t actively hunt except for the odd insect or so, whereas a hungry “Monk
                  Vulture” (so-called for its hood of dark feathers) might swoop on live prey in a very un-vulture-like manner.
                  In terms of feeding ecology, it can tear through the toughest hides and even crunch through smaller bones –
                  tasks that smaller vultures leave behind. In fact, a Cinereous Vulture in a group can monopolize a carcass simply
                  by virtue of size and aggression, similar to how a Lappet-faced Vulture rules in Africa. Unlike the social Griffons,
                  Cinereous Vultures are more loners or in pairs; they nest singly in big stick nests in trees or cliff ledges and
                  don’t form large colonies. This solitary, heavyweight lifestyle is quite distinct.

Designed prompt: To illustrate the Cinereous Vulture in pixel form, one could lean into its “monk” persona: a chibi vulture dressed
                 in a tiny black robe with a hood, maybe holding a book or staff, giving it a wise hermit vibe (a fun play on its
                 Latin name).


-> Lappet-faced Vulture Aegypius tracheliotos

SSpanish: Buitre Orejudo
German: Ohrengeier
French: Vautour oricou
aka: King Vulture, Nubian Vulture, Eared Vulture, Sociable Vulture
Taxonomy: Subfamily Aegypiinae
Size: Length 37–45 in (95–115 cm); wingspan 98–114 in (250–290 cm);
12–21 lb (5400–9400 g)
Estimated world population: <10,000; declining
Movements: Largely sedentary; juveniles and subadults nomadic
Social ecology: Relatively solitary, territorial breeding; communal
roosting; individual and group food finding

Special trait(s): The carcass kingpin. The Lappet-Faced Vulture is the alpha vulture of Africa, armed with a monster beak and
                  intimidating size. It gets its name from the floppy folds of skin (lappets) on its neck and face, which flush
                  pink and may help radiate heat – but those lappets also give it a permanent “frowny bulldog” expression. This
                  species’ standout trait is its sheer power in feeding: it can rip through the tough hide of large carcasses and
                  even crack open bones to get at marrow and brains. In African savannas, a dead elephant or giraffe with thick
                  skin would be nearly impenetrable to smaller vultures; enter the Lappet-faced Vulture, which acts like nature’s
                  can opener and hammer combined. Thanks to its massively strong bill, it tears off skin and tendons that others
                  can’t handle, often opening carcasses for all the other scavengers to dine. In doing so, it ensures nothing goes
                  to waste – even hide and large bones eventually get processed. Behaviorally, Lappet-faceds are feisty and assertive.
                  They are usually first or among the first at a carcass, and they won’t hesitate to chase off smaller vultures;
                  they’ve even been seen scaring off jackals. They are the most likely to engage in fights, using their size to
                  dominate a feeding site. Interestingly though, they can be a bit cautious about landing when a carcass is surrounded
                  by too many rivals – they often circle and wait until they’re sure they can assert control. If there’s just a couple
                  of White-backs around, a Lappet-faced will land and they’ll scatter; but if 50 White-backs are in a frenzy, the big
                  guy might hold off until the chaos calms (after all, even a king doesn’t dive into a mob recklessly). Lappet-faceds
                  also have a varied diet – they’ll take flamingo eggs or flamingo chicks from nests, and catch locusts or termites
                  during swarms, showing a surprising versatility for such a large bird.

Designed prompt: For pixel art, the Lappet-Faced Vulture can be a fun “tough guy” character. Picture a chibi vulture with big, cute
                 jowls or lappet flaps and a tiny angry eyebrow line (for comedic effect). It could hold a cartoon can opener tool
                 or a bone it just snapped, proclaiming its strength.

SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS

1. Reproduction is an essential aspect of the biology of scavenging
   birds of prey. Without it there would be no next generation, and
   extinction would follow.
2. Vultures breed seasonally, especially in response to carcass and
   updraft availability.
3. Excepting several larger and often more predatory species in
   which females are notably more massive than their male counterparts,
   males and females differ little in body mass, except for Andean Condors,
   in which males are larger than females. The Bearded Vulture, a species
   in which siblicide occurs, also exhibits reversed sexual size dimorphism,
   that is, the females are larger.
4. Almost all vultures and condors delay maturity, most likely
   because it takes multiple years to develop carcass-searching and
   territorial skills necessary for successful breeding.
5. Multi-year pair fidelity is typical in scavenging raptors. Extra-pair
   copulations do occur, as does within-year mate switching.
6. Territoriality occurs in some, but not all, vultures.
7. Breeding success, which varies with food availability, weather, and
   predation, appears to be high in many species, although this may
   be so because it has been studied in areas with relatively dense
   and, presumably highly successful, populations.
8. Carrion is neither as scarce nor as unpredictable as many scien-
   tists suggest, and vultures are well adapted to secure it.
9. Exclusive carrion diets have both costs and benefits. Carcasses
   are digestible and nutritious, but many are potentially infec-
   tious, toxic, or both.
10. Agricultural practices serve to increase the foraging efficiencies of
    vultures by concentrating nutritional resources in space and time.
11. Many vultures are direct or indirect human commensals that ben-
    efit and are benefited by living in human-dominated landscapes.
12. Vultures require and use low-cost, non-flapping, soaring flight
    to fly long distances when engaged in low-cost searching flight.
13. All vultures use sight while searching for carrion. A few species
    also use smell and possibly sound to locate carrion and other
    nutritional resources.
14. Social facilitation resulting from both single and multi-species
    aerial information networks makes it possible for vultures to fol-
    low one another to carrion, which is an essential component of
    effective food finding in vultures.
15. Social facilitation also results in large assemblages of hungry
    vultures at carrion, which typically creates considerable intra-
    and interspecies competition.
16. Behavioral competition among vultures at feeding sites is both
    kinetic and complex, and aggressive interactions can be intense.
17. Larger species behaviorally dominate smaller species at feeding
    sites, but conspecific groups or gangs of smaller vultures can
    outcompete larger species.
18. Vultures are sometimes, but not typically, cannibalistic.
19. Vultures sometimes approach and hasten the demise of a dying
    animal, which they then feed upon even while it is still alive.
